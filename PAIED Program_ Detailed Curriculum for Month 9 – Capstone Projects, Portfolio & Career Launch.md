**PAIED Program: Detailed Curriculum for Month 9 – Capstone Projects, Portfolio & Career Launch**

**Month Overview** This final month is your **graduation showcase**—synthesizing everything from Months 1–8 into 2–3 production-grade, AI-powered products. You'll plan, build, iterate, and launch full projects (e.g., a complete Flutter app with fine-tuned model, agents, MCP integrations, Supabase backend). True to our philosophy—"They may not believe the papers, but you will get paid for the working projects"—this month emphasizes shipping polished, public work that attracts real clients, employers, or investors.

You'll also build a professional portfolio site and learn strategies to monetize your skills. No new theory—just application and launch\!
