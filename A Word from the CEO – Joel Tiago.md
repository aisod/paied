**A Word from the CEO – Joel Tiago**

**Welcome to the Practical AI Engineering \& Development (PAIED) Program!**

Dear Future AI Builders,

As the CEO of AISOD, I am incredibly proud to welcome you to this transformative journey. In a world where AI is reshaping everything, Namibia and Africa must not just consume technology—we must **create and own it**. That's why we built the PAIED Program: to empower beginners like you with practical, hands-on skills to design, code, automate, and launch real AI-powered products in hours—not years.

Our philosophy is simple and powerful: *"They may not believe the papers, but you will get paid for the working projects."* Here, there are no endless exams or abstract theory. Your success is measured by what you **build and launch**—websites, mobile apps, agents, custom models—all using ethical AI tools and our preferred stack (Flutter/Dart, React Native, Next.js, Supabase, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, LoRa, TensorFlow, Haggingface, GitHub, Langchain and etc,...).

Over these 9 months, you'll go from zero experience to shipping professional-grade solutions that solve real problems in Namibia—from business automations to innovative apps. And with AISOD X as your ecosystem, your projects can earn income, attract funding, and impact communities.

This is more than a program—it's your entry into Africa's AI revolution. We're here to support you every step: mentors, community, live sessions, and tools to make complex things simple.

Dream Big. Believe in yourself. Build boldly. Launch fearlessly.

The future is yours to code.
