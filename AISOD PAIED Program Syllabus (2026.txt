AISOD PAIED Program Syllabus (2026 Edition)
Program Name: Practical AI Engineering & Development (PAIED) Program 
Delivered by: AISOD Institute 
Launch Year: 2026 
Start Dates:
•	Non-workers cohort (full-time learners, students, youth): January 6, 2026
•	Workers cohort (part-time, professionals): February 7, 2026
Duration: 9 Months (flexible pacing: 10–15 hours/week for non-workers; 8–12 hours/week for workers) 
Format: Online/Hybrid Vocational Program (self-paced modules, live webinars, mentorship, peer community) 
Target Audience: Absolute beginners with no prior coding or design experience — youth, school learners, women, career changers, working professionals, and entrepreneurs in Namibia and beyond. Basic computer literacy required.
Program Philosophy: "They may not believe the papers, but you will get paid for the working projects. Therefore, Learn by Building and Launching functioning projects in hours."
Success is measured only by completed, publicly published, and functioning projects (e.g., live websites, mobile apps, AI agents, GitHub repositories, design prototypes) — not by exams or theory tests. We use modern AI tools to simplify complex topics, enabling beginners to ship real products fast and prove their skills in the marketplace.
Key Outcomes:
•	Build and launch multiple real-world AI-powered products (websites, mobile apps, automations, agents).
•	Gain hands-on mastery of in-demand tools and languages.
•	Develop a strong public portfolio of launched projects that attracts freelance clients, employers, or investors.
•	Become capable of earning income through freelancing, selling digital products, or launching startups.
Prerequisites: None — 100% beginner-friendly. AI tools bridge all gaps. 
Ethical AI Commitment: We teach and enforce responsible, ethical use of AI throughout the program (bias awareness, data privacy, transparency, originality in work).
Cost Structure (2026):
•	School Learners (via AI Clubs): N$1,334 per learner (one-time or instalments)
•	Standard Individual: N$200 per month
•	Free Access: Included for all AISOD X Premium subscribers
•	Scholarships: Available for underserved groups, women in tech, rural youth, and high-potential applicants
Preferred Technology Stack (Core Focus):
•	Mobile & Cross-Platform: Flutter + Dart (primary)
•	Web Development: Next.js + React
•	Alternative Mobile: React Native
•	Backend & Database: Supabase
•	AI & Scripting: Python Other tools introduced as needed, but these are prioritized for simplicity, speed, and modern industry demand.
Assessment & Progression:
•	Fully project-based.
•	Each module ends with a public launch milestone (e.g., live URL, GitHub repo, app demo).
•	Mentors review using clear rubrics (functionality, usability, ethical AI use, documentation).
•	Progression is gated: Complete and publish the milestone to unlock the next module.
•	No exams, no theory quizzes — real shipped work is the only proof.
