PAIED Program: Detailed Curriculum for Month 4 – AI-Powered Mobile Development  
Month Overview Welcome to mobile\! You'll now transform your Month 2 Figma prototypes into real cross-platform mobile apps using our primary stack: Flutter \+ Dart. This builds directly on Month 3 (web with Next.js/Supabase), shifting to native-feeling apps that run on Android/iOS/web. Per our philosophy—"They may not believe the papers, but you will get paid for the working projects"—focus on launching quickly with AI help (e.g., prompting for Dart code). Integrate Supabase for backend (auth, data)—no separate servers needed.  
By month's end, you'll publish a working mobile app (e.g., APK share or web build) based on your prototypes. This is freelance-ready—clients pay for apps like these\!  
Ethical AI Focus: Generate code ethically (modify outputs); ensure app features promote inclusivity (e.g., offline support for Namibia's connectivity).  
Resources Provided: Free Flutter/Supabase setup. Weekly live webinars (recorded). Mentor reviews. Community for troubleshooting.  
Weekly Effort: 13 hours (non-workers) or 11 hours (workers). Use AI to accelerate—target functional builds in hours.
