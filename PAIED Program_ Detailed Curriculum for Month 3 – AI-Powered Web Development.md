PAIED Program: Detailed Curriculum for Month 3 – AI-Powered Web Development  
Month Overview This is where you start coding and launching real websites—turning your Month 2 Figma prototypes into live, functioning web apps. True to our philosophy—"They may not believe the papers, but you will get paid for the working projects"—you'll build full-stack sites quickly using AI assistance (e.g., Grok/Claude for code generation). We prioritize Next.js \+ React for modern, fast web apps, integrated with Supabase for backend (auth, database). Focus on responsive, mobile-first design (building on Month 2\) and simple AI features (e.g., chatbots or recommendations).  
By the end, you'll launch a complete, deployed website (live URL on Vercel) using one of your Month 2 prototypes. This proves your skills—share the link to attract freelance gigs\!  
Ethical AI Focus: Use AI for code suggestions ethically (modify outputs, cite if sharing); ensure inclusive features (e.g., accessible UI).  
Resources Provided: Free Vercel/Supabase accounts. Weekly live webinars (recorded). Mentor code reviews. Community for debugging help.  
Weekly Effort: 12 hours (non-workers) or 10 hours (workers). Use AI to speed up—aim to launch in hours per feature.

Month 3 Milestone Project  
Project: Launch a fully functional website (e.g., portfolio, e-commerce mockup, Namibia business directory) using your Month 2 prototype. Include Supabase backend (e.g., user data) and one AI feature. Deploy on Vercel (live URL required). Add README with ethical notes. (6–8 hours total.) Rubric: Functionality (50%), Responsiveness/Design (20%), AI Integration (15%), Ethical Practices (10%), Deployment Quality (5%). Mentor approval unlocks Month 4—your first paid-project-ready site\!  
Launch it and share the link—clients pay for working sites like this\! 🚀
