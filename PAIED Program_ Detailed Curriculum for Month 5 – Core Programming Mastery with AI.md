PAIED Program: Detailed Curriculum for Month 5 – Core Programming Mastery with AI  
Month Overview Now that you've launched web and mobile apps, this month deepens your programming fluency in our priority languages: Python (AI/scripting), Dart (Flutter/mobile), and JavaScript/TypeScript (Next.js/web). You'll apply concepts to real problems, using AI tools ethically for debugging and ideas—proving our philosophy: "They may not believe the papers, but you will get paid for the working projects."  
Focus on clean, efficient code that powers freelance-ready apps. By the end, you'll refactor and enhance a prior project (Month 3 or 4), relaunching it with advanced features.  
Ethical AI Focus: Use AI for suggestions/explanations only; always modify code for originality; document contributions.  
Resources Provided: Free VS Code extensions (e.g., Python/Dart). Weekly live webinars (recorded). Mentor code reviews. Community for pair programming.  
Weekly Effort: 13 hours (non-workers) or 11 hours (workers). AI accelerates learning—target clean code in hours.
