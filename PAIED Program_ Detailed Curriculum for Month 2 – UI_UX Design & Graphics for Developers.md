PAIED Program: Detailed Curriculum for Month 2 – UI/UX Design & Graphics for Developers  
Month Overview This month shifts from AI theory to visual creation, teaching you to design professional, user-friendly interfaces and graphics that make your future apps/websites stand out. Following our philosophy—"They may not believe the papers, but you will get paid for the working projects"—you'll use ethical AI tools to generate assets quickly, then refine them manually for originality and quality. By the end, you'll launch 3 complete, interactive prototypes publicly on Figma Community—these become mandatory blueprints for your Month 3–4 coding projects (gated progression).  
Focus on mobile-first design (our priority for Flutter/Dart apps), accessibility, and ethical practices (e.g., original compositions, bias-free visuals). No prior design skills needed—AI assists heavily, but you learn to own the output.  
Ethical AI Focus: Always cite/modify AI-generated graphics; avoid copyrighted styles; ensure inclusivity (e.g., diverse representations).  
Resources Provided: Free Figma account (start here: figma.com). Weekly live webinars (recorded). Mentor feedback. Community forum for sharing drafts.  
Weekly Effort: 12 hours (non-workers) or 10 hours (workers). Split into daily 2-hour sessions.  
Week 1: UI/UX Principles, User Flows, Accessibility, and Mobile-First Design  
Objectives: Grasp core principles; learn mobile-first (design for small screens first); prioritize accessibility for real-world impact.  
Lessons & Topics (2–3 hours/day):  
1\.	UI vs. UX Basics (Day 1): UI (visuals) vs. UX (experience); hierarchy, balance, contrast.  
2\.	Mobile-First & Responsive Principles (Day 2): Why start mobile (faster loading, Namibia's high mobile use); breakpoints, flexible grids.  
3\.	User Flows & Wireframing (Day 3): Mapping user journeys (e.g., login → dashboard); low-fidelity sketches.  
4\.	Accessibility Essentials (Day 4): Color contrast (WCAG standards), screen reader support, keyboard navigation; ethical inclusivity.

Resources:  
•	Figma's Free "Design Basics" Guide (mobile-first section).  
•	Great Learning/Free Figma Course (accessibility module).  
•	YouTube: "Mobile-First Design Principles 2026" tutorials.  
Hands-On Activities (3–4 hours):  
•	Sketch a simple user flow on paper/phone notes (e.g., Namibia tourism app).  
•	Mini-Project: Ethical prompt for a mobile layout idea; sketch low-fi wireframe in Figma.  
Assignment: Create a basic wireframe for a simple app (e.g., task list); include accessibility notes. Share in forum.  
Week 2: Ethical Graphics Creation (Icons, Logos, Banners via AI Tools)  
Objectives: Generate and refine graphics ethically; focus on originality for commercial use.  
Lessons & Topics (2–3 hours/day):  
1\.	Graphics Fundamentals (Day 1): Icons, logos, banners; vectors vs. raster.  
2\.	Ethical AI Image Tools (Day 2): Free/open alternatives (e.g., Leonardo.Ai free tier, Flux via Hugging Face demos, Craiyon for basics).  
3\.	Prompting for Graphics (Day 3): Ethical prompts (e.g., "Original flat icon set for Namibia farming app, diverse users").  
4\.	Refinement & Originality (Day 4): Import to Figma; manual edits for uniqueness.  
Visual Examples (ethical AI-generated style icons/graphics):

Resources:  
•	Leonardo.Ai or Flux free tiers (ethical, commercial-safe options).  
•	Udemy Free "Learn Figma" (graphics section).  
Hands-On Activities (3–4 hours):  
•	Generate 5 icons ethically; import/edit in Figma.  
•	Mini-Project: Create a logo for your future app idea.  
Assignment: Build an asset library (10 graphics); document ethical sources/process.  
Week 3: Prototyping in Figma (Interactive Mockups)  
Objectives: Turn designs into clickable prototypes; add interactions.  
Lessons & Topics (2–3 hours/day):  
1\.	Figma Interface Deep Dive (Day 1): Layers, components, auto-layout.  
2\.	Building Screens (Day 2): From wireframes to high-fi (using Week 2 graphics).  
3\.	Interactions & Prototyping (Day 3): Links, overlays, animations.  
4\.	Testing Prototypes (Day 4): Share links; gather feedback ethically.  
Visual Examples (interactive prototype mockups):

Resources:  
•	Figma Community Templates (mobile prototypes).  
•	YouTube Beginner Tutorials (e.g., "Figma Mobile App Prototype 2026").  
Hands-On Activities (3–4 hours):  
•	Build 3 screens for a sample app; add basic interactions.  
•	Mini-Project: Prototype a login flow.  
Assignment: Complete one full prototype draft; test with a peer.  
Week 4: Design Systems and Iteration  
Objectives: Create reusable components; iterate based on feedback.  
Lessons & Topics (2–3 hours/day):  
1\.	Design Systems (Day 1): Components, styles, variables.  
2\.	Iteration & Feedback (Day 2): Ethical critique (inclusive language).  
3\.	Final Polish (Day 3): Export assets; prepare for publishing.  
4\.	Namibia Context (Day 4): Localize designs (e.g., cultural colors).

Month 2 Milestone Project  
Project: Design and publish 3 interactive prototypes (e.g., e-commerce app, task manager, Namibia tourism app) on Figma Community/Behance. Include ethical graphics, mobile-first layout, accessibility checks. Share live links \+ short demo video. (6–8 hours total.) Rubric: Visual Quality (40%), Functionality/Interactions (30%), Ethical & Accessibility (20%), Documentation (10%). Mentor approval unlocks Month 3—use these exact designs as coding blueprints\!  
You're now ready to turn designs into live apps. Excited for your launches—share in the community\! 🚀
