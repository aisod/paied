PAIED Program: Detailed Curriculum for Month 6 – AI Agents & Automation Development  
Month Overview This month introduces agentic AI—autonomous systems that plan, reason, and execute multi-step tasks (a 2026 hotspot). You'll build practical agents and automations using Python (primary for AI) and LangChain frameworks, optionally tying into Supabase Functions for backend deployment. Aligning with our philosophy—"They may not believe the papers, but you will get paid for the working projects"—focus on launching real agents (e.g., business bots) that solve Namibia-relevant problems.  
By the end, you'll launch a public AI agent demo (GitHub repo \+ live example), ready for freelancing (e.g., client automations).  
Ethical AI Focus: Ensure agents avoid bias; handle data privately; transparency in actions.  
Resources Provided: Free Hugging Face/LangChain access. Weekly live webinars (recorded). Mentor reviews. Community for collaboration.  
Weekly Effort: 14 hours (non-workers) or 12 hours (workers). AI tools speed prototyping.  
Week 1: Agent Concepts and Planning  
Objectives: Understand agentic AI; learn planning/reasoning loops.  
Lessons & Topics (2–3 hours/day):  
1\.	Agentic AI in 2026 (Day 1): Agents vs. simple bots; reasoning engines.  
2\.	Core Components (Day 2): Tools, memory, planning (ReAct pattern).  
3\.	Use Cases (Day 3): Namibia examples (e.g., farming advisor agent).  
4\.	Ethical Planning (Day 4): Avoiding harmful actions; user consent.
