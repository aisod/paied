**PAIED Program: Detailed Curriculum for Month 1 – AI Essentials & Foundations**

**Month Overview** This foundational month sets the stage for your PAIED journey by demystifying AI and equipping you with essential skills to build and launch functioning projects quickly. Aligned with our philosophy—"They may not believe the papers, but you will get paid for the working projects. Therefore: Learn by Building and Launching functioning projects in hours"—we emphasize ethical AI use from day one. You'll explore AI's potential in 2026, master prompting to generate code/designs ethically, address real-world ethical challenges, and set up a development environment focused on our preferred stack (Python, Supabase, Flutter/Dart React and Next.js).

No prior experience needed—AI tools like Grok or Claude will assist every step or the AISOD tutors. By month's end, you'll launch your first public project: a GitHub repo of ethical, reusable prompts with a demo video proving functionality.

**Ethical AI Focus**: All activities stress responsible use—e.g., citing AI-generated content, avoiding biased prompts, respecting privacy.

**Resources Provided**: Access free tools via AISOD X (if Premium) or open links. Weekly live webinars (1 hour, recorded) for Q\&A. Mentor office hours (book via platform). Community forums for peer support.

**Weekly Effort**: 10–12 hours (non-workers) or 8–10 hours (workers). Break it into 2–3 sessions/week.

**Week 1: What AI Can Do in 2026 – Trends, Agentic AI, and Namibia Opportunities**

**Objectives**: Understand AI's evolution by 2026; identify agentic AI trends; explore local applications for Namibia (e.g., agriculture, education, startups). Build excitement by launching a simple AI-assisted task.

**Lessons & Topics** (2–3 hours/day):

1. **AI Basics & 2026 Landscape** (Day 1–2): Define AI, ML, LLMs, and agentic systems (AI that plans/executes autonomously). Project 2026 trends: Multimodal AI (text+image+video), self-improving agents, edge AI for low-resource areas like Namibia.  
2. **Agentic AI Trends** (Day 3): How agents automate workflows (e.g., business bots, data analysis). Real-world examples: AI in African agriculture (crop prediction) or education (personalized learning).  
3. **Namibia-Specific Opportunities** (Day 4): AI for local challenges—e.g., water management, tourism apps, youth entrepreneurship. Tie to AISOD X ecosystem for earning.
