**PAIED Program: Detailed Curriculum for Month 1 – AI Essentials & Foundations**

**Month Overview** This foundational month sets the stage for your PAIED journey by demystifying AI and equipping you with essential skills to build and launch functioning projects quickly. Aligned with our philosophy—"They may not believe the papers, but you will get paid for the working projects. Therefore: Learn by Building and Launching functioning projects in hours"—we emphasize ethical AI use from day one. You'll explore AI's potential in 2026, master prompting to generate code/designs ethically, address real-world ethical challenges, and set up a development environment focused on our preferred stack (Python, Supabase, Flutter/Dart React and Next.js).

No prior experience needed—AI tools like Grok or Claude will assist every step or the AISOD tutors. By month's end, you'll launch your first public project: a GitHub repo of ethical, reusable prompts with a demo video proving functionality.

**Ethical AI Focus**: All activities stress responsible use—e.g., citing AI-generated content, avoiding biased prompts, respecting privacy.

**Resources Provided**: Access free tools via AISOD X (if Premium) or open links. Weekly live webinars (1 hour, recorded) for Q\&A. Mentor office hours (book via platform). Community forums for peer support.

**Weekly Effort**: 10–12 hours (non-workers) or 8–10 hours (workers). Break it into 2–3 sessions/week.

**Week 1: What AI Can Do in 2026 – Trends, Agentic AI, and Namibia Opportunities**

* Build/Launch Mini-Project: Use AI to generate a simple Namibia-focused idea (e.g., "AI bot for crop advice") and share in community forum.

**Assignment**: Journal 3 AI trends relevant to your goals; discuss ethical implications (e.g., job displacement in Namibia). Submit to mentor for feedback.

**Week 2: Advanced Prompt Engineering**

**Objectives**: Master prompting to create functioning outputs in hours (e.g., code snippets, ideas). Emphasize ethical techniques to avoid harm/misinformation.

**Lessons & Topics** (2–3 hours/day):

1. **Prompt Basics to Advanced** (Day 1–2): Zero-shot vs. few-shot; chain-of-thought (CoT) for reasoning; role-playing (e.g., "Act as a Namibian AI developer").  
2. **Techniques for 2026** (Day 3): Structured prompts (JSON outputs); iterative refinement; tool-calling for agents.  
3. **Ethical Prompting** (Day 4): Avoid biased language; ensure originality; prompt for diverse perspectives (e.g., "Include Namibia viewpoints").

**Resources**:

* **Tutorial**: "The Ultimate Guide to Prompt Engineering in 2025" by Lakera (step-by-step with examples).  
* **Video**: "The ADVANCED 2025 Guide to Prompt Engineering" on YouTube (20 min; master perfect prompts).  
* **Interactive Guide**: Promptingguide.ai (free catalog; practice CoT).  
* **Ethical Add-On**: IBM's Prompt Engineering resources (focus on responsible use).

**Hands-On Activities** (3–4 hours):

* Practice 10 prompts in Grok/Claude: E.g., "Generate ethical Python code for a simple Namibia weather app" (cite AI, check bias).  
* Build/Launch Mini-Project: Prompt AI for a business idea; refine with CoT; post refined version in forum.

**Assignment**: Create 5 advanced prompts (e.g., role-playing for app ideas); test functionality; submit with ethical notes.

**Week 3: Ethical AI Use**

**Objectives**: Deep dive into responsible AI; apply to real scenarios; ensure all future projects prioritize ethics.

**Lessons & Topics** (2–3 hours/day):

1. **Core Ethical Principles** (Day 1–2): Bias detection, privacy (e.g., data handling in Supabase), transparency (citing AI use).  
2. **2026 Challenges** (Day 3): AI in Namibia (e.g., cultural bias in models); global issues like deepfakes.  
3. **Practical Application** (Day 4): Ethical checklists for prompting/coding; case studies (e.g., AI in education).

**Resources**:

* **Guide**: "AI Ethics 101: A Beginner's Guide to Respectful AI Use" (practical tips).  
* **Lesson Plan**: PBS "AI Unlocked – Ethical Considerations" (free activities for beginners).
