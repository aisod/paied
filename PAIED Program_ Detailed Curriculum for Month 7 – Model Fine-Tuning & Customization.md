PAIED Program: Detailed Curriculum for Month 7 – Model Fine-Tuning & Customization  
Month Overview This month empowers you to customize pre-trained AI models ethically for specific tasks—e.g., Namibia-focused chatbots or local language support. Using Python and Hugging Face (with LoRA for efficient tuning on limited hardware), you'll adapt models without massive resources. True to our philosophy—"They may not believe the papers, but you will get paid for the working projects"—focus on launching tuned models integrated into prior apps (e.g., from Months 3–6).  
By the end, you'll fine-tune a model, integrate it into an existing project, and publish it publicly (Hugging Face repo \+ demo)—a high-value skill for freelance clients\!  
Ethical AI Focus: Prioritize bias-free data; privacy (anonymize); transparency (document changes); inclusivity (e.g., underrepresented languages).  
Resources Provided: Free Hugging Face account (hub for models). Weekly live webinars (recorded). Mentor reviews. Community for dataset sharing.  
Weekly Effort: 14 hours (non-workers) or 12 hours (workers). Use free Colab for compute.  
Week 1: Model Basics (Pre-Trained vs. Custom)  
Objectives: Understand model types; why/when to fine-tune.  
Lessons & Topics (2–3 hours/day):  
1\.	Pre-Trained Models (Day 1): Open-source LLMs (e.g., Mistral, Llama variants via HF).  
2\.	Full vs. Parameter-Efficient Tuning (Day 2): LoRA introduction (low-rank adapters—efficient for beginners).  
3\.	When to Customize (Day 3): Domain adaptation (e.g., Namibia business queries).  
4\.	Ethical Foundations (Day 4): Model cards; responsible sourcing.

Month 7 Milestone Project  
Project: Fine-tune a model (e.g., for Namibia Q\&A or local domain); integrate into a prior project (e.g., agent/app). Publish on Hugging Face (repo \+ Space demo). Include model card with ethical notes. (6–8 hours total.) Rubric: Performance Improvement (40%), Ethical Handling (30%), Integration (15%), Documentation/Deployment (15%). Mentor approval unlocks Month 8—custom models clients pay premium for\!
